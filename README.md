This is my first project on GitHub
Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning.
Technologies: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, XGBoost, SVM, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Streamlit
Preprocessed customer data to address missing values and outliers for churn prediction.
Applied various ML algorithms.
Identified Monthly Contract, Tenure, and Total Charges as key churn predictors.
Deployed the model using Streamlit for real-time churn predictions, making it accessible to non-technical users.
